    "    Sound is a presseure change in pressure in air\n",
    "    - sound = rapid changes of air pressure\n",
    "    - sound travels through space as a pressure wave \n",
    "    - sound is a longitudinal wave\n",

    "2. What is a pure tone? Why is it referred to as a sinusoid:\n",
    "\n",
    "    A pure tone is a sound wave characterized by a single frequency, meaning it consists of only one frequency component without any harmonics or overtones. It is referred to as a sinusoid because the waveform of a pure toneis mathematically described by a sine wave, which is a fundamental trigonometric function representing simple harmonic motion.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "3. What is a waveform:\n",
    "\n",
    "    A weveform it the representation(shape, pattern) of the sound in time domain\n",
    "   \n",
    "<img width=\"300px\" src=\"./block_1/waveform.gif\">    \n",
    "\n",
    "4. What is frequency, amplitude and phase of a pure tone:\n",
    "    - FREQUENCY: The number of cycles per second (Hz).\n",
    "    - AMPLITUDE: The magnitude of the sinewave (e.g. Pascal).\n",
    "    - PHASE: The point at which the sinusoid starts (in deg or rad)\n",

    "5. What is a complex signal:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    A complex signal is a combination of multiple pure tones.\n",
    "    Since the wave does not have the ‘simple’ form of the sinewave anymore it is called a complex wave\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "6. Why is frequency, amplitude and phase particularly meaningful for pure tones and not for complex signals:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Frequency, amplitude, and phase are particularly meaningful for pure tones because a pure tone is a single-frequency waveform where these parameters directly define its pitch (frequency), loudness (amplitude), and starting point of the waveform (phase). In contrast, complex signals contain multiple frequencies and phase relationships, making these parameters more complex to interpret and analyze.\n",
    "    \n",
    "7. What is a spectrum:\n",
    "\n",
    "    A spectrum refers to a representation of a signal or wave in terms of its frequency components. It shows how the energy or amplitude of the signal is distributed across different frequencies. A spectrum can be obtained by performing Fourier transform on the signal, which decomposes it into its constituent frequency components. The spectrum provides valuable information about the frequency content of the signal, including dominant frequencies, harmonics, and overall frequency characteristics\n",

    "\n",
    "8. What does the spectrum of a complex signal never look like:\n",
    " \n",
    "    It will have never have only one peak, since it conists of multiple sinusoids with different frequencies, therefore it will have multiple peaks\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "9. What does the waveform of a complex signal never look like:\n",
    "\n",
    "    The waveform of a complex signal never looks like a simple, regular sinusoidal wave or a straightforward repetitive pattern. \n",
    "    \n",
    "10. How do you calculate frequency from a given period duration:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    $T$ is the perdion and and $f$ the frequncy\n",

    "13. Name different ways for measuring amplitude and their pros and cons:\n",
    "    - peak measure\n",
    "    <img width=\"600px\" src=\"./block_1/peakmeasure.jpg\">\n",
    "        - pros\n",
    "            - Simple and straightforward method\n",
    "            - Provides a clear indication of the signal's maximum amplitude.\n",
    "        - cons\n",
    "            - Does not account for the distribution of energy across the signal.\n",
    "            - May not represent the overall \"strength\" or energy content of the signal accurately, especially for complex singal.\n",
    "    - root-mean-square $$ \\text{RMSE} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i)^2} $$ $x_i$ are the measure points of the signal\n",
    "        <img width=\"600px\" src=\"./block_1/root_mean_measure.jpg\">\n",
    "        - pros\n",
    "            - Provides a measure of the effective \"strength\" or power of the signal by considering the entire amplitude distribution.\n",
    "            - Reflects the heating or power dissipation characteristics of the signal (relevant in electrical applications).\n",
    "        - cons\n",
    "            - More computationally intensive compared to peak measurement.\n",
    "            - Can be influenced by transient spikes or noise in the signal, although it generally provides a more representative measure of amplitude compared to peak value alone.\n",

    "14. What is the difference between a linear scale like Pa, mm or V and the Decibel scale:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Decible scale uses as logarithmic scale and and a refrence Pressure.\n",
    "    Decibels represent relative differences or ratios rather than absolute values. They quantify the logarithmic relationship between two quantities\n",

    "    - Rescale Data\n",

    "        - e.g. 1 000 000 – 200 000 000 µPa less detailed \n",

    "    \n",
    "    The term \"dBSPL\" stands for decibels Sound Pressure Level\n",
    "    It refers to the threshold of hearing (0 dbSPL).\n",
    "    Reference Level (SPL0): The reference pressure level used in dBSPL is typically 20 micropascals (μPa), which is considered the threshold of human hearing at a frequency of 1 kHz. Therefore, dBSPL measures the sound pressure level relative to this reference level.\n",
    "\n",
    "17. What do positive and negative numbers of the dBSPL scale imply: \n",
    "    - 0 dB does not mean no sound; it means the same as the reference\n",
    "    - Any positive number of dB means greater than the reference (e.g., 10 dB)\n",
