    "    Sound is a presseure change in pressure in air\n",
    "    - sound = rapid changes of air pressure\n",

    "2. What is a pure tone? Why is it referred to as a sinusoid:\n",
    "\n",
    "    A pure tone is a sound wave characterized by a single frequency, meaning it consists of only one frequency component without any harmonics or overtones. It is referred to as a sinusoid because the waveform of a pure toneis mathematically described by a sine wave, which is a fundamental trigonometric function representing simple harmonic motion.\n",

    "    \n",
    "    A complex signal is a combination of multiple pure tones.\n",
    "    Since the wave does not have the ‘simple’ form of the sinewave anymore it is called a complex wave\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "6. Why is frequency, amplitude and phase particularly meaningful for pure tones and not for complex signals:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Frequency, amplitude, and phase are particularly meaningful for pure tones because a pure tone is a single-frequency waveform where these parameters directly define its pitch (frequency), loudness (amplitude), and starting point of the waveform (phase). In contrast, complex signals contain multiple frequencies and phase relationships, making these parameters more complex to interpret and analyze.\n",

    "7. What is a spectrum:\n",
    "\n",
    "    A spectrum refers to a representation of a signal or wave in terms of its frequency components. It shows how the energy or amplitude of the signal is distributed across different frequencies. A spectrum can be obtained by performing Fourier transform on the signal, which decomposes it into its constituent frequency components. The spectrum provides valuable information about the frequency content of the signal, including dominant frequencies, harmonics, and overall frequency characteristics\n",

    "1. Explain the fundamental idea of the source-filter model:\n",
    "    The source-filter model of speech production describes how speech sounds are created. It proposes two main components:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Source: The vibrating vocal cords produce a raw sound source.\n",
    "    - Filter: The vocal tract modifies this sound through resonance, shaping it into distinct speech sounds.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    By changing the configuration of the vocal tract (like tongue position or lip shape), different sounds are produced. This model helps explain how we create specific speech sounds and study their acoustic properties.\n",

    "\n",
    "2. What is meant by source and filter being independent? What can you do with the source, what with the filter:\n",
    "    In the source-filter model, the independence of the source and filter means they can be adjusted separately:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Source: Manipulating the source involves changing properties like pitch and intensity by altering vocal cord vibration.\n",
    "    - Filter: Manipulating the filter involves changing vocal tract shape (tongue, lips, jaw) to modify resonance and produce different speech sounds.\n",

    "3. How does the back cavity of the vocal tract and the front cavity relate to the highest point of the tongue:\n",
    "    By adjusting the position of the highest point of the tongue along with the configuration of the vocal tract's back and front cavities, different vowel sounds are produced. This relationship demonstrates how articulatory adjustments in the tongue and vocal tract contribute to the distinct qualities of vowels in spoken language.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "4. How do the back and front cavities of the vocal tract play together to produce vowels in a two-tube model:\n",
    "    <img width=\"400px\" src=\"./block_3/cavities.jpg\">\n",
    "    In the two-tube model, the vocal tract is represented by two interconnected tubes: a longer tube representing the pharyngeal cavity (back cavity) and a shorter tube representing the oral cavity (front cavity).\n",
    "    These tubes are considered to be resonators that can independently amplify certain frequencies of the sound produced by the vocal cords (the source).\n",
    "    \n",
    "    The length of each tube (front and back cavity) can be adjusted by changing the configuration of the vocal tract, primarily through movements of the tongue, lips, and jaw.\n",
    "    Shortening or lengthening these tubes alters their resonant frequencies, which in turn affects the acoustic properties of the sound passing through them.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Role of Back Cavity:\n",
    "    The back cavity (pharyngeal cavity) influences the resonance of low-frequency components of the sound. By changing the size and shape of the back cavity (e.g., by lowering or raising the soft palate), different resonant frequencies are emphasized or attenuated.\n",
    "    In back vowels (like [ɑ] or [u]), the back cavity is relatively larger and more open, favoring resonance of lower frequencies.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Role of Front Cavity: The front cavity (oral cavity) affects the resonance of higher-frequency components of the sound. Altering the shape and size of the oral cavity (e.g., by varying tongue height and advancement) changes the resonant frequencies amplified by this cavity.\n",
    "    In front vowels (like [i] or [e]), the oral cavity is relatively smaller and more constricted, favoring resonance of higher frequencies.\n",
    "5. What is a three-tube model of the vocal tract:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    The three-tube model of the vocal tract is a theoretical framework used to describe vowel production based on the acoustic properties of three interconnected resonating tubes that represent different regions of the vocal tract. This model builds upon the concept of the two-tube model by further dividing the vocal tract into additional segments to better capture the complexity of vowel articulation and resonance.\n",

    "    - F2: Influenced by the length and configuration of the oral tube (middle cavity). Longer tube length corresponds to lower F2 frequencies.\n",

    "\n",
    "7. Which vowels are the corner vowels and what does that mean:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Corner vowels are important because they represent extreme positions within the vowel space, serving as anchor points for describing and comparing other vowels based on their articulatory characteristics and acoustic properties. They provide a standardized framework for analyzing and classifying vowels in different languages and speech varieties.\n",
